## End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project, I tried to achieve a near-perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of React. This entire journey of this has given me experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave me a lot of confidence. More products can be added if I have more time.

## In the project directory:

&&: `npm start`
