      "productdescription": "When it comes to quality and color, no one does cashmere quite like we do. Our best-selling and crazy-soft sweaters are the result of over 30 years of expertise, obsessing over fit, durability and handfeel. The result? They're soft and warm while still being lightweight, which means they're the perfect layer to wear on crisp autumn days, under a jacket in colder months...even with a tee on chilly summer nights. This raglan-sleeve sweater is knit in a cozy waffle texture (think of it as a cousin to your favorite thermal). We're proud to support responsible cashmere production through our partnership with the Aid by Trade Foundation (AbTF), a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agricultural development across the globe. As the foundation's first U.S. member, we source cashmere that is certified to the AbTF's The Good Cashmere Standard®, which ensures the welfare of the cashmere goats, protects natural resources and improves the working conditions of farmers and farmworkers in Inner Mongolia."

We also use our (proprietary) multistep wash process to achieve a soft, broken-in feel from day one. Organic cotton is grown without toxic chemicals or GMOs (genetically modified organisms), which means it's better for the health of the soil, the ecosystem and the people who farm it.

Our design team spent months perfecting and wear-testing our new classic fit to get the silhouette just right—we like to think of it as the ultimate 'everyday' shirt. Every bit as perfect as an under-blazer layer as it is with jeans, this fit has a little extra room and a just-right length. This version is extra-luxe, thanks to a special silk we picked in a blind touch test for its next-level smooth texture. Plus, we created a custom label for it."

Hemp is stronger than cotton, so this shirt is sturdier than your average tee and will only get softer the more you wash it. Organic cotton is grown without chemical fertilizers and pesticides from non genetically modified seeds."

If you've been looking for the perfect hoodie, your search is over. French terry is the finest variation of terry cloth, and is knit from two separate yarns—one that stays taut, and another that creates the loose loops, called 'piles,' on the back of the fabric. Because this hoodie is garment-dyed, it has a perfectly imperfect color that will softly fade over time. Our designers were inspired by vintage style (athletes and workers have been wearing hoodies for the better part of a century) and included details like ribbed side panels that are true to the original."
